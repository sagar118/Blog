I started learning about python in my college days, I read the book [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://github.com/tranlamkhanhtuong/Learn-Python-3-The-Hard-Way). A very good book for beginners. [Introduction to Python Programming](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110) by Udacity is a free course that covers the basics of Python. [Introduction to Python](https://courses.analyticsvidhya.com/courses/introduction-to-data-science) is another free course by Analytics Vidhya. Another free course by Google is [Google’s Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/).\n",

    "- Matplotlib is a visualization library in python. In the [matplotlib tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/matplotlib-tutorial-python), you will learn the basics of Python data visualization, the anatomy of a Matplotlib plot, and much more. [Official documentation](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html) of matplotlib is one of the best ways to learn the library.\n",
    "- Seaborn is another visualization library built on top of matplotlib. Kaggle [short course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization) on data visualization provides a good start point to learn the library."
